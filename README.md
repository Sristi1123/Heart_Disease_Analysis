# Heart_Disease_Analysis
This project predicts heart disease using machine learning. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and model building (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM). Accuracy is shown through graph. Feature importance highlights key health factors. Built using Python, Pandas, Sklearn, and Seaborn.
📌 What's Inside?
We analyzed a dataset of patient medical records and built models that can predict whether someone has heart disease or not. This includes steps like:

📂 Loading and cleaning the data

📊 Exploring the data visually (heatmaps, histograms, etc.)

🔄 Encoding categorical values

🔍 Scaling features and handling missing values

🤖 Building and comparing machine learning models:

Random Forest

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
📈 Visualization
